# jarl-react 0.8.x

Just Another Router Library for React.

## Philosophy

*   URLs are a public API into your appplication
*   Routes define a mapping between URL and state
*   Routing is a core part of your application logic
*   A router should not dictate state mechanism nor navigation lifecycle
*   Data dependencies are closely bound to routes

Putting all of this together, I wanted a router that performs the simple-sounding
task of keeping the URL and the state in sync, whilst not getting in the way
of application structure, and not requiring learning a component API for
basic conditional rendering tasks. For example, JARL does not have a `Route`
component: you can simply inspect your state and render using `if` and `switch`.

Routes are described using simple serializable state objects. The route table is then a
mapping between URLs and these objects. This provides some key benefits:

*   The state can be stored in Redux, local state, or any other storage mechanism,
    and used for making any rendering decisions
*   URLs don't ever need to be used inside your application, instead Link can build
    its URL from state objects, making it very easy to tweak your route structure at any time
*   React Native support becomes very easy since we can drop the URLs entirely and everything still works!

Some examples of state mapping:

`/about` -> `{page: "about"}`
`/product/:productId` -> `{page: "product", productId: <string>}`

All routing can be described using this simple approach.

## Concrete Example

Add to your project:

```
yarn add jarl-react
```

Declare a routing table:

```js
const routes = [
    // Home page route
    {
        path: "/",
        // Model the state however you want!
        // Here we decided to use a `page` property to
        // switch between pages:
        state: { page: "home" }
    },
    // Another static page
    {
        path: "/about",
        state: { page: "about" }
    },
    // A dynamic URL for viewing products
    {
        path: "/products/:productId",
        // The `productId` property be merged into state when the
        // route matches
        state: { page: "product" },
        // Nested child routes are straightforward:
        routes: [
            {
                path: "/comments",
                // All the state will be merged down the branch,
                // so we'll end up with the following:
                // { page: "product", productId: <id>, tab: "comments" }
                state: { tab: "comments" }
            }
        ]
    },
    // Dynamic (and in brackets for optional) query parameters:
    {
        path: "/search?q=:search&sort=(:sortKey)",
        state: { page: "search" }
    },
    // Finally a catch-all `*` route for any bad URLs...
    {
        path: "/*:missingPath",
        state: { page: "404" }
    }
];
```

Load the routes and a `history` implementation of your choice into your `NavigationProvider`:

```js
const history = createBrowserHistory();
ReactDOM.render(
    <NavigationProvider history={history} routes={routes}>
        <App />
    </NavigationProvider>,
    rootElement
);
```

(See [history](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history) package for `createBrowserHistory` and other options!)

And finally in your `App` component you can inject the state to perform the actual routing:

```js
import { withLocation } from "jarl-react";

// All our possible state variables are made available in the App
const App = ({ page, productId, search, sortKey, tab, missingPath }) => {
    // Our routing is just one big switch statement - no component needed!
    switch (page) {
        case "home":
            return <HomePage />;
        case "about":
            return <AboutPage />;
        case "product":
            // Inside ProductPage we'll have a similar switch or some other
            // conditional to maybe render a tab...
            return <ProductPage productId={productId} tab={tab} />;
        case "search":
            return <SearchPage search={search} sortKey={sortKey} />;
        case "404":
            return <MissingPage path={missingPath} />;
    }
};

// State is actually injected into App using the `withLocation` higher-order component
export default withLocation()(App);
```

Wait, we missed something! How do you actually link to a page? JARL has a Link component much like other router libraries, but its unique feature is that we can actually generate URLs from exactly the same state objects as specified in our routing table. Your main menu might look like this:

```js
import { Link } from "jarl-react";

const MainMenu = () => (
  <nav>
    <Link to={ page: "home" }>Home</Link>
    <Link to={ page: "about" }>About</Link>
    <Link to={ page: "product", productId: 123 }>Our Best Product Ever!</Link>
    <SearchForm />
  </nav>
)
```

These links will use the routing table in reverse to stringify all the correct URLs to your pages, e.g. the product link will become `<a href="/product/123">`.

The `SearchForm` component needs to handle links in a slightly different way, as it needs to programmatically navigate to the search page. It looks like this:

```js
// The `withNavigate` HOC will inject a function we can use for navigation
import { withNavigate } from "jarl-react";

class SearchForm extends React.Component {
    state = { searchText: "" };

    handleChange = (e) => {
        // Standard controlled input state management
        this.setState({searchText: e.target.value});
    }

    handleSearch = () => {
        // Navigate function has been injected into props. Just pass it another state
        // object -- JARL will figure out the correct URL, i.e. `/search?q=some%20text`
        this.props.navigate({ page: "search", search: this.state.searchText });
    }

    render() {
        <form>
            <input type="text" value={this.state.searchText} onChange={this.handleChange} placeholder="Enter search term" />
            <button onClick={this.handleSearch}>Search</button>
        </form>
    }
)

// Export class and decorate with the HOC
export default withNavigate()(SearchForm);
```

That's all the basics! Hopefully this gave a flavour of the power and simplicity of this routing system. More advanced demos (such as data preloading, state mapping, Redux integration) will be showcased in the demo site...
